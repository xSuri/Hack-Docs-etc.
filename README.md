# This is Walkthrough
# Info
I am constantly improving my own skills and so far I do not share my projects very much, I am aware of many possible errors.

All is in .md or file's scripts to hack machine. I'm beginner and I learn day for. Maybe can be make better.
Not everything is only mine knowledge as I mentioned, I am still learning and also having someone's knowledge (I am mostly self-taught), adds my own observations, etc.
Have Fun!


if I have not described something (because I do not always have the feel like writing and time) check if I have solved it and write to me, I will try to help you <:

# Info #2

He writes here about some machines doing the so-called The "writeups", unfortunately I didn't describe them all and now I probably won't be able to do it because there are "some" of them. Hope I won't skip now none. (it should be here with time and possibilities more and more writeups and stuff from different ctf's etc).
