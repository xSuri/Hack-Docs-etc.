# Flag:

- SINFULZ {DUMPED_SECRETS_ON_PUBLIC_SITES_ARE_REAL}

# Tutorial:

1) First, I entered the phrase on Google


"Yummy Crusty Pizza" and saw Twitter


2) I read the Twitter entries and saw the link to the page I provided

3) clicking on the database was the information that the database was "leaked". I tried to complete the .sql and saw that it shows the files with the given name.

4) then I searched duckduck.go and others for github etc. I found myself


https://github.com/yummycrustypizza?tab=packages
https://www.webwiki.com/yummycrustypizza.com


But I found nothing there

5) I saw other links to social networks on the site. I clicked on instagram and there was a flag there.


https://www.instagram.com/yummycrustypizza/


showed the first false flag: SINFULZ {We're_n0_str4ng3rs_t0_l0v3}


6) I searched further I went to the site
https://www.aware-online.com/en/osint-tools/web-archive-tools/


and clicked on the link to https://archive.org/


I typed https://yummycrustypizza.com/


I entered the database and saw the passwords


7) I got the password (http://web.archive.org/web/20210222081058/https://yummycrustypizza.com/database.html) -> sinfulz -> db0edd04aaac4506f7edab03ac855d56

8) I found out that it was an md5 hash and went to a random site https://hashtoolkit.com/decrypt-hash/?hash=db0edd04aaac4506f7edab03ac855d56 and decrypted it.

9) More on twitter -> https://twitter.com/YMMYCRSTYPZZA/status/1363798004478615553

Where was the link to the secret recipe:

and saw the final flag
